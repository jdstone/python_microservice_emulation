# Microservices Emulation

This program emulates a microservice in Python by creating and interacting with files.
Three processes in three separate terminal windows run at the same time. Run them in this order:

1. Run prng.py
2. Run image.py
3. Run ui.py (follow instructions in this program)

## Overview
To demonstrate you can implement the microservices architecture, write software comprised of three separate programs:

1. A program that generates pseudo-random numbers (**PRNG Service**)
2. A program that, given a non-negative integer i, returns the i<sup>th</sup> image in a set (order doesnâ€™t matter) (**Image Service**)
    * If i is >= the number of images, modulo i by the size of the image set
3. A user interface (**UI**) that either has a button or can receive a user command. When the button is pushed or the command is entered...

    1. UI calls the PRNG Service
    2. UI calls the Image Service using the pseudo-random number from the PRNG Service
    3. UI displays the image (or a path to it)


Use any set of images. **Store images locally in a folder**; no API calls needed. No DB needed.

## Requirements

* UI must either have a button (if UI is graphical) or be able to receive a user command (if UI is text-based)
* Each of the three programs must run in a **different process**
* Programs must **NOT call each other** directly (e.g., do not import one program into another)
* As the **communication pipe**, use text files as follows:
    1. UI calls PRNG Service by writing the word "run" to prng-service.txt
    2. PRNG Service reads prng-service.txt, erases it, and writes a pseudo-random number to it
    3. UI reads prng-service.txt to get the pseudo-random number
    4. UI writes the pseudo-random number to image-service.txt
    5. Image Service reads image-service.txt, erases it, and writes an image path to it
    6. UI reads image-service.txt then displays the image (or path) to the user
